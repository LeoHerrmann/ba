# Realization

This directory contains the Python 3 source code implementing the practical part of the thesis.

## Contents

`measurement_environment/`
- Environment for evaluating the robustness of implemented agents under different scenarios.

`ppo_training/`
- Various approaches attempted to train a PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) agent for Connect Four.

## Prerequisites

To work with the Python source code, I'd recommend to:
- use Python 3.12
- setup and activate a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows).
- install required dependencies via pip3 install -r requirements.txt.
